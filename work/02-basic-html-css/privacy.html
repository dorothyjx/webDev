	<p>If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect.
		We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. 
		This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>
	
	<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor's browser type, 
		language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request.
		We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. 
		You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account. 
		You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."</p>
	
	<p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. 
		Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of "User Personal Information."</p>
	
	<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. 
		We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.
		Information will not be sold to any parties.</p>
